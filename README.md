# D&amp;D Fighter Game
This is an old project from my first year as a Communication &amp; Multimedia Design student, it's written completely in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
During this project we had to make one of three things, either a: Customizer, Tamagotchi or a Fighter game, made out of pure JS, where the focus laid on JS, not on HTML or CSS (although it of course was needed to make this game).
